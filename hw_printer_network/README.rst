==========================
 Hardware Network Printer
==========================

The module adds support for a Network Printer through a POS Box.

When printing an order using this module, the POS Box receives the IP address of the network printer and the receipt from the client's POS.
If the ip address is not empty, it will be connected to the network printer at this address which in turn prints the receipt.
